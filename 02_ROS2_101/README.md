The content of this lesson will be an overview of the C++ API for ROS 2. The ADE environment will be used for the lecture, which is a *dockerized* container of ROS. During the lesson, most of the ROS 2 Dashing tutorials will be installed and some of them will be explained in more detail, providing hints, tips and tricks during the process. Also, the ROS 2 CLI interface will be introduced, but the next lesson will cover it in more detail.

The provided slides in PDF format can be found in the Apex.AI's [autowareclass2020 repository](https://gitlab.com/ApexAI/autowareclass2020/-/blob/master/lectures/02_ROS2_101/lesson2.pdf), in GitLab.
