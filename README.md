# Autoware.auto Course Notes
This repository will contain the notes I took during my course on Autoware.auto, a ROS-based software stack for autonomous vehicle development, the biggest free software standard for this purpose.

This course uses the open source robotics framework ROS 2 and the Autoware.Auto algorithms, which are covered through the 14 lectures of it, which show state-of-the-art techniques to combine hardware, software, algorithms, methodologies, tools and data to build useful applications in the autonomous system context. It is oriented to students with previous experience in related fields and knowledges of C++, testing, robotics frameworks and system integration.

The learning platform are the student's personal computers with [ade-cli](https://ade-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Each lecture will be provided by YouTube and have an associated *.md* file [here](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/) that will be followed by the lecturer to record the videos. They will also use [ade-cli](https://ade-cli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A new lecture will be uploaded weekly starting from the Monday 11th of May 2020.

Each folder in this repository contains the notes (in *.md* files) of one of the lectures (listed in the *Collaborators* section of this README) and its name will start by the correspondent lesson number. There is one additional folder, *0_additional_information*, which contains relevant related information I gathered both before and during the course.
