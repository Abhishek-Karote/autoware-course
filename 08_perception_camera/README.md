The lecture will cover how to use 2D camera data to detect objects in real scenarios. In particular, it will go through detecting lanes, vehicles and pedestrians with neural networks and the toolboxes that may be used for those purposes. Also, a lane detection node in ROS 2 will be created.

The provided slides in PDF and notes about the lab of the lecture can be found in the Apex.AI's [autowareclass2020 repository](https://gitlab.com/ApexAI/autowareclass2020/-/blob/master/lectures/08_Perception_Camera), in GitLab. The slides in PDF and the lab notes in MarkDown are included in the *resources* folder of this directory. The code used in the lecture video is available [here](https://gitlab.com/ApexAI/autowareclass2020/-/tree/master/code/src/08_Perception_Camera).
